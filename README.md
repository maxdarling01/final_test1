# this code uses healthcare that provides a persons height, weight, gender, and index from 0-5 that stats whether they are weak(0) or extremely overweight(5). This linear regression model predicts the persons index. Only data processing needed was encoding the gender variable into a numeric value as linear regression does not take strings. After this the train and test of the data was performed. The results were a MSE of .36 and R-squared of .77. The MSE is relatively low, meaning the difference in the predicted and actual values were small, showing strong performance. The R-squared tells us that 77% of the variance is explained by the model, this is above average giving confidence to use this model.
